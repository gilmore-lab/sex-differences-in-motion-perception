- Place Stereo Acuity Test and Glasses on table
- Place Color Vision Test on table
- Place the Vision Screening Score Sheet on the table

#### Review vision screening procedures

The vision screening protocol may be reviewed at [this link](vision-screening-protocol.html)

### Set up for computer-based tasks 

#### Stimuli Computer

 ![Specific Settings](images/pp3.PNG)   
 
#### Survey Computer

- Log-in to survey computer with your individual PSU login
- Load page with surveys: <https://pennstate.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5AoCVwYH7ZsXFQh>. **UPDATED 2020-1-23**.

#### Pick Participant ID
- Participant IDs are listed on the whiteboard in the lab.
- Please select the smallest number
    - Enter this into the Qualtrics Survey
    - Enter this into the Temporal duration threshold task
    - Enter this into the Contrast sensitivity task
    - Write this on the Vision Scoring Sheet
- Cross this number out with the brown marker on the whiteboard.

#### Daily Schedule
- The Daily Schedule will be located in the green folder

### After participant arrives 

#### Welcome participant

Say:

>"*Welcome to the brain, behavior, and development lab. Are you here for the study about individual difference of motion perception?*"

Close the door.
If the participant answers yes, say:

>"*Great. You can sit in this chair and put your coat and bags beside you.*"

>"*Do you have your cell phone or is it with your bag/coat? If you have your cell phone, please place it with your bag/coat.*"

- Store coat on back of main door and bags by the file/bookcase.

>"*Are you \<NAME OF PERSON ON SONA SYSTEMS SITE SCHEDULED FOR THIS SESSION\>?*"

- If the participant answers yes, say:

>"*Ok. We want to make sure that you get credit for participation. Please sit here for the first portion of the study.*"

- Have the person sit at the computer where the survey will be taken.

#### Begin the survey

Conduct the implied verbal consent.

>"*Welcome. Today you are going to participate in a set of questionnaires, two computer visual tasks and a few vision screening measures. Your participation is voluntary and you may decide to stop at any time. You do not have to answer any questions that you do not want to answer. You will receive course credit for your participation. You may review the consent form on the screen in front of you. Do you have any questions?*"

Once the consent is complete (It means the participant clicks to the next page), enter participant ID

- Following the consent page, there is a Participant ID blank spot on the top of visual acuity test page. Please use the smallest number available on the white board. *Take a note* of this participant ID in "Penn State Vision Screening Score Sheet". Enter this number into the Qualtrics Survey and each of the computer tasks. 

- Do not choose a number before the participant arrives.

- When you use a Participant ID from the white board, please cross it out with the brown dry erase marker. All used numbers will be erased at the end of the day.

Then say,

>"*Great. Now we'd like to move on to the first vision screening test. Could you stand behind this line?*"

### Complete pattern visual acuity testing

```{r, child="snellen-screening-protocol.Rmd"}
```

### Stereo acuity and color vision tests

>"*Please come sit over here at this table.*"

Escort participant to table.

```{r, child="color-stereo-screening-protocol.Rmd"}
```

- write down the performance of these three visual tests in qualtrics.

### Questionnaires

>"*Thank you. Now we'd like to move on to the questionnaires. Please sit down. You can follow the instructions and finish the survey. Feel free to ask me if you have any questions. Let me know when you finish it.*"

- Have the participant sit back down at the computer.
- Let the participants finish the questionnaire.
- Answer the questions if the participants have any, when they work on the questionnaires. 
- But be in careful in the hobby page, spatial and verbal page, because the time is recorded. The page will vanish when the time has passed. So, depending on the nature of the questions, answer them fast and emphasize the time is recorded in this page.

After answering the question, say:   
>"*Be aware: there is a time limit for this page. *"

- If the participant has questions in the instruction page of the hobby test, spatial and verbal test, answer carefully and make sure the participants understand. 
-	After the participants finish the questionnaire, ask them if they need a little break. If the participant wants to keep going, lead them to the test room

Say:

>"*You have finished this part. Next you have two computer tasks. Do you want to continue or have a little break?*"


### Set-up for computer-based tasks

- Guide participant to the testing room.
- Have them sit in the chair.
- Adjust the monitor and participant position.
    - The monitor should be located **60cm** from the bridge of the nose on the participant.
    - *place the rear legs of the chair exactly in front of black strips*
    - The chair height should be set so the participant is looking in the middle of the screen.
- Guide the participant to use the arrow keys for responses and the space bar to advance the screen.
- *check with participants that they do not bring the cell phone to the dark room*


Say:


>"*Please come to this room for the behavioral tests. Sit in the chair. Could I move the chair a little bit? I want to make sure every particpant is the same distance from the computer screen. Please sit up straight and have your back touching the chair. Do not move your chair.*"


>"*Please do your best and focus on the center of the screen during these tasks.*"


### Run computer-based tasks

#### Select run order

The order of the computer experiments will be randomized across participants based on the participant ID entered into Qualtrics.

- run the *temporal duration threshold task* first (Murray et al.) if the ID number is *EVEN*.
- run the *contrast sensitivity task* first (Abramov et al.) if the ID number is *ODD*.
*Record the task run first on the experiment run log.*

#### Temporal duration threshold task (Murray et al.)

**Run FIRST if EVEN number for Participant ID**

```{r, child="murray-etal-task.Rmd"}
```

#### Contrast sensitivity task (Abramov et al.)

**Run FIRST if ODD number for Participant ID**

```{r, child="abramov-etal-task.Rmd"}
```

## After session ends

### Thank participant

- After the participant finishes all the tests, thank him/her.

>"*These are all the tasks for today. Thank you for participation. We appreciate your time. Do you have any questions?*"

- Answer any questions the participant might have. You may direct them to Yiming or to Dr. Gilmore if you are unable to answer the question.
- If the participant ask the purpose of this study, read the debrief

```{r, child="debief-script.Rmd"}
```

>"*Okay. The principal investigator will give you the credit by the end of the next business day.*"

- Say bye to participants

### Give participant credit on SONA

- Yiming or Andrea will assign credit in SONA.

### Clean-up

- Mark on the daily schedule sheet in the green folder if:  
    - the participant was Present or a No Show  
    - the number used for that participant if Present  

- Clean keyboard, mouse and table and begin [data export](sex-differences-data-export.md) (separate protocols).

For the last participant of the day:
- Copy the data of this participant to the hard drive
