## Before participant arrives

- Check to see if there have been any cancellations.

### Vision Screening 

#### Preparation

Materials for vision screening are stored on the table next to Andrea's office.

- Make sure the black tape is on the floor 10ft from the HOVT Snellen Acuity Chart which is on the door to 503B
- Place Stereo Acuity Test and Glasses on table
- Place Color Vision Test on table

#### Administration Instructions



<!-- # Vision Screening Instructions -->

# Snellen Acuity (Child/Adult)

## Procedure

- Have participant stand 10 feet away from the chart on the wall (black tape on the floor)
- Ask the participant to start with the top line and have the participant read the first symbols in every line in descending order
- If they miss a letter, circle it on the score sheet.
- Move back up one line and ask the participant to identify all the optotypes on that line. If the participants identifies all symbols correctly, go to the next line with smaller optotypes and ask the child to identify all optotypes on the line.
- Their visual acuity will be the one that matches the line on which 50% (3 of 5, 4 of 6) of the symbols are identified correctly.

## Report results

- Log the answer to each item on the [score sheet](vision-screening-data.md).
- Log the acuity for the participant in terms of 10 ft (e.g. 10/10)

# Color Test (Child/Adult)

## Procedure

- The examination should be done indoors with bright, natural illumination of more than 300 lux.
-The plates should be held at a distance of 50 - 75 cm (20-30 inches)
- The first exam:
    - *Skip: Examiner shows the participant plate 1 or 2, tracing the red line. Recognized as "circle", "square", or some other design.
    - Plate 3 and 4. The participants are required to say outloud "circle", "square", or some other design. If the shape is correctly recognized, mark as normal.If the shape is not correctly recognized, mark as abnormal.
- The second exam:
    - Skip: Examiner shows the participant plate 5. Recognized as a curve line. 
    - Plate 6: In tracing the winding line between the upper left mark x and lower right mmark x, the normal traces the red curve, but the abnormal usually trace the blue.
    - Plate 7: In tracing the winding line between the upper left mark x and lower right mark x, the normal traces the upper green curve, but the abnormal usually trace the lower red curve.
    - Plate 8: In tracing the winding line between the upper left mark x, the normal can trace upper and lower curve and come back to the starting mark. In case of the abnormal, some can trace either 

## Report results

- Log the answer to each item on the score [score sheet](vision-screening-data.md).
- Those who can not recognize any curve in plate 8 at all, or any lower curve are definitely abnormal.
- They might be abnormal if they misjudge more than 3 plates among plates 3,4,6,7
- If they misjudge 1-2 plates among plates 3,4,6,7, it is better to re-examine him in details from plate 1-8. 

## Stereo Vision Test

### Procedure

- Have the participant put the stereo glasses on.
- Provide good light, make sure the pictures maintain the proper axis of polarization before the participants at 15 minutes of arc at a distance of 16 inches.
- Only do the circle test. Point to each item on the left hand side of the page going left to right and up to down. 
- Start with No.1. Say to the participant:" Look at each of the four circles and tell me which one seems to come out closer to you-top, bottom, right, or left." Continue until participant gives up trying, or making two successive mistakes.
- Some participants may develop this perceptual response slowly. So let them study it for a while, if needed.3

### Report results

- Log the answer to each item on the [score sheet](vision-screening-data.md).
- Record the level of stereopsis at the last one chosen correctly.

## After participant arrives

### Welcome participant

Say:

>"*Welcome to the brain, behavior, and development lab. Are you hear for the study about motion perception?*"

If the participant answers yes, say:

>"*Great. You can put your things here.*"

- Store belongings in **X**.



>"*Are you <NAME OF PERSON ON SONA SYSTEMS SITE>?*"

- If the participant answers yes, say:

>"*Ok. We want to make sure that you get credit for participation. Please sit here for the first portion of the study.*"

- Have the person sit at the computer where the survey will be taken.

### Begin the survey

- Enter the ID: YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM based on appointment time

Conduct the implied verbal consent.
You may say to the participant or have them read the following text:





You are being invited to volunteer to participate in a research study. This summary explains information about this research.	

-	The purpose of this voluntary research study is to investigate how human beings perceive motion in an experimental setting and how this ability is related to personal interests and other abilities. 
The results of this research study will help scientists gain a deeper understanding of what contributes to individual differences in motion perception, and whether or how motion perception is correlated with other aspects of life. 
-	You will complete some computer-based surveys about your background, personal interests, spatial and verbal abilities (~25 min). Then, you will complete one or two short (10-20 min) computer tasks in which you will attempt to detect motion or recognize the direction of motion presented on a computer screen.
-	All questionnaire and computer task data you provide will be saved using a numeric code. No information about your identity or how to contact you will be saved with the data. 
-	If you are participating as part of the Psychology Subject Pool, you will receive course credit for participating (at the rate of ½ credit per ½ hours) as specified in the syllabus provided by your instructor. This means you will get 1 credit for participating this research. Alternative means for earning this course credit are available as specified in the syllabus.

If you have questions, complaints, or concerns about the research, you should contact Yiming Qian at 814-863-3116 or Rick Gilmore at 814-865-3664.
If you have questions regarding your rights as a research subject or concerns regarding your privacy, you may contact the Office for Research Protections at 814-865-1775. 

Your participation is voluntary and you may decide to stop at any time.  You do not have to answer any questions that you do not want to answer. 

Clicking the “Take The Survey” button implies two things: (1) that you are at least 18 years of age, and (2) you voluntarily consent to participate in the research. 
Thank you!

Once the surveys are complete, say:

>"*That's great. Now we'd like to move on to the vision screening portion of the study. Are you ready?*"

- If the participant says yes, proceed.

### Complete vision testing

- Complete [pattern acuity test](vision-screening.Rmd)
  - Adult - HOTV @ 10ft

### Questionnaires

- Let the participants finish the items
-	A little break for the participants. If the participant wants to keep going, lead him to the test room

Say:

>"You have finished the first part of testing. Next you have behavorial testing. Do you want to continue or have a little break?"

### Experimental Setup

- Guide participant to testing room.
- Have them sit in the chair.
- Adjust the monitor and participant position.
- The monitor should be located **60cm** from the bridge of the nose on the participant.
- The chair height should be set so the participant is looking directly at the **X** in the middle of the screen.
- Guide the participant to use the arrow keys for responses.

### Run Experiments

The order of the computer experiments will be randomized across participants using **X** procedure.

#### Murray et al.



- Open PsychoPy by clicking on the icon located on the desktop.
- When PsychoPy opens, open the file for this experiment.
    - From the `File` menu, select the `Open Recent...` command and select the `motion-temporal-threshold.py` file.
- When the file opens, run the experiment by pressing press the green (running person) button.
    - **Be careful not to type in the programming window.**
    - A welcome screen with the following message will appear: *Welcome to the motion duration threshold study. Press any key to continue.*
- When you are ready to enter the participant ID, press a key on the keyboard.
    - A pop-up window will appear.
    - Enter the participant ID in the pop window, and press the `Ok` button to enter the data.
- Speak to the participant

>“In this task, you will try to detect whether a small patch of stripes is moving to the left or to the right. The time the patch appears on the display will get shorter and shorter. Our goal is to find out the shortest duration you need to reliably detect the direction of motion."

>"This task takes about 2 min to complete. But to make sure that we get reliable results, we'll need to do it 4 times. You can take a short break between the sections."

>"Put your fingers on the left and right arrow keys. You'll press the left arrow if you see motion to the left and the right arrow if you see motion to the right. If you aren't sure, just guess."

>"Are you ready. Ok, let's go."

#### Abramov et al.

- Open the files "" located in folder.
- In PsychoPy, press the green button. 
- Enter the ID in the pop window and speak to the participant.
