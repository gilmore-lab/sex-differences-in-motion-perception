## Murray et al.

- contrast levels (low = 3%, high = 98%) 
- Diameter = 0.84, 1.7 and 10° 
- Motion speed was 4 cycles/s (Hz)
- spatial frequency was 1.2 cycles/°. 
- Gratings were presented within a circular aperture, whose edges were blurred with a Gaussian envelope (SD = 0.21°)
- Trials began with a central fixation mark, a small shrinking circle (850 ms). 
- This was followed by a blank screen (150 ms)
- after which the grating stimuli appeared (variable duration controlled by a staircase procedure, range 6.7 – 333 ms)
- followed by another blank screen (150 ms), and finally a fixation mark (the response cue)
