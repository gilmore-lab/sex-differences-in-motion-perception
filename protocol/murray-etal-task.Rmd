>â€œIn this task, you will try to detect whether a small patch of stripes is moving to the left or to the right. The time the patch appears on the display will get shorter and shorter. Our goal is to find out the shortest duration you need to reliably detect the direction of motion."

>"This task takes about 2 min to complete. But to make sure that we get reliable results, we'll need to do it 4 times. You can take a short break between the sections."

>"Put your fingers on the left and right arrow keys. You'll press the left arrow if you see motion to the left and the right arrow if you see motion to the right. If you aren't sure, just guess."

>"Are you ready. Ok, let's go."
