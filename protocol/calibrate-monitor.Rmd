### Run Matlab Script

- At a minimum a black (0,0,0) and white (255,255,255) image must be displayed on the projector screen 
- The script to do this is located on Github: https://gilmore-lab.github.io/photometer_proj
 
### Measure Luminance

- Measure the value of each image on the projector screen with the light meter.

### Log values

- Log the values in the file Box Sync/gilmore-lab/protocols-procedures/projector-calibration.xls
