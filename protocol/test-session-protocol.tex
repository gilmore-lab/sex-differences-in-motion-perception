Please sit here for the first portion of the study.}''
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Have the person sit at the computer where the survey will be taken.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Begin the survey}\label{begin-the-survey}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You will see the Participant ID on the top of implied consent.
  \emph{Take a note} of this participant ID (only the numeric code
  without comma or hyphen) in ``Penn State Vision Screening Score
  Sheet''.
\end{itemize}

Conduct the implied verbal consent.

\begin{quote}
``\emph{Welcome to this study. You could read the research summary of
this study and click next button to move to the next page. There is one
thing I want to highlight: your participation is voluntary and you may
decide to stop at any time. You do not have to answer any questions that
you do not want to answer. }''
\end{quote}

Optional: You may say to the participant or have them read the following
text:

``You are being invited to participate in a research study.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The purpose of this voluntary research study is to investigate how
  human beings perceive motion in an experimental setting. The results
  of this research study will help scientists gain a deeper
  understanding of what contributes to individual differences in motion
  perception, and whether or how motion perception is correlated with
  other aspects of life.
\item
  You will complete one computer-based surveys. Then, you will complete
  two short computer tasks in which you will attempt to detect motion on
  a computer screen.
\item
  All questionnaire and computer task data you provide will be saved
  using a numeric code. No information about your identity or how to
  contact you will be saved with the data.
\item
  If you are participating as part of the Psychology Subject Pool, you
  will receive course credit for participation as specified in the
  syllabus provided by your instructor. This means you will get 1 credit
  for participating this research. Alternative means for earning this
  course credit are available as specified in the syllabus.
\end{itemize}

If you have questions, complaints, or concerns about the research, you
could contact principal investigator Yiming Qian or her advisor Rick
Gilmore. If you have questions regarding your rights as a research
subject or concerns regarding your privacy, you could contact the Office
for Research Protections.

Your participation is voluntary and you may decide to stop at any time.
You do not have to answer any questions that you do not want to answer.

Clicking the ``Next'' button implies two things: (1) that you are at
least 18 years of age, and (2) you voluntarily consent to participate in
the research. Thank you!"

Once the consent is complete (It means the participant clicks to the
next page), say:

\begin{quote}
``\emph{That's great. Now we'd like to move on to the vision screening
test of the study. Could you stand behind this line?}''
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Complete pattern visual acuity
testing}\label{complete-pattern-visual-acuity-testing}

\subparagraph{Procedure}\label{procedure}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Have participant stand 10 feet away from the chart on the wall (black
  tape on the floor)
\item
  Ask the participant to start with the top line and have the
  participant read the first symbols in every line in descending order
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
``Could you read the first symbols in each line for me from the top to
bottom?''
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If they miss a letter, circle it on the score sheet.
\item
  Move back up one line and ask the participant to identify all the
  optotypes on that line. If the participant identifies all symbols
  correctly, go to the next line with smaller optotypes and ask the
  participant to identify all optotypes on the line.
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
``Could you read all the symbols in this line? And this line?''
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Their visual acuity will be the one that matches the line on which
  50\% (3 of 5, 4 of 6) of the symbols are identified correctly.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Report results}\label{report-results}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Log the answer to each item on the
  \href{vision-screening-score-sheet.html}{score sheet}.

  Log the acuity for the participant in terms of 10 ft (e.g.~10/10)
\item
  Report the result into Qualtrics
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Questionnaires}\label{questionnaires}

\begin{quote}
``\emph{Thank you. Now we'd like to move on to the questionnaires.
Please sit down. You can follow the instructions and finish the survey.
Feel free to ask me if you have any questions. And let me know when you
finish it.}''
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Have the participant sit back down at the computer.
\item
  Let the participants finish the questionnaire.
\item
  Answer the questions if the participants have any, when they works on
  the questionnaires. But in careful in the hobby page, spatial and
  verbal page, because the time are recorded. The page will vanish when
  the time have passed. So, depending on the nature of the questions,
  answer them fast and emphasize the time is recorded in this page.
\end{itemize}

After answering the question, say: \textgreater{}``\emph{Beware: there
is a time limit for this page. }''

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the participants have questions in the instruction page of hobby
  test, spatial and verbal test, answer careful and make sure the
  participants understand well.
\item
  After the participants finish the questionnaire, ask them if they need
  a little break. If the participant wants to keep going, lead them to
  the test room
\end{itemize}

Say:

\begin{quote}
``\emph{You have finished this part. Next you have two computer tests.
Do you want to continue or have a little break?}''
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Set-up for computer-based
tasks}\label{set-up-for-computer-based-tasks-1}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist

  strips}
\item
  The chair height should be set so the participant is looking in the
  middle of the screen.
\item
  Guide the participant to use the arrow keys for responses and the
  space bar to advance the screen.
\end{itemize}

Say:

\begin{quote}
``\emph{Please come to this room for the behavioral tests. Sit in the
chair. Could I move the chair a little bit? I want to make sure you are
at the right distance to the computer screen. Please sit straight and
have you back touching the chair.Do not move your chair.}''
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Run computer-based tasks}\label{run-computer-based-tasks}

\paragraph{Color Test}\label{color-test}

\subparagraph{Procedure}\label{procedure-1}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The examination should be done indoors with bright, natural
  illumination of more than 300 lux.
\item
  The plates should be held at a distance of 50 - 75 cm (20-30 inches)
\end{itemize}

Say:

\begin{quote}
``Look at this picture and tell me what you see.''
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The first exam:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    *Skip: Examiner shows the participant plate 1 or 2, tracing the red
    line. Recognized as ``circle'', ``square'', or some other design.
  \item
    Plate 3 and 4. The participants are required to say outloud
    ``circle'', ``square'', or some other design. If the shape is
    correctly recognized, mark as normal.If the shape is not correctly
    recognized, mark as abnormal.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The second exam:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Skip: Examiner shows the participant plate 5. Recognized as a curve
    line.
  \item
    Plate 6: In tracing the winding line between the upper left mark x
    and lower right mark x, the normal traces the red curve, but the
    abnormal usually trace the blue.
  \item
    Plate 7: In tracing the winding line between the upper left mark x
    and lower right mark x, the normal traces the upper green curve, but
    the abnormal usually trace the lower red curve.
  \item
    Plate 8: In tracing the winding line between the upper left mark x,
    the normal can trace upper and lower curve and come back to the
    starting mark. In case of the abnormal, some can trace either
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Report results}\label{report-results-1}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Log the answer to each item on the score
  \href{vision-screening-score-sheet.html}{score sheet}.
\item
  Those who can not recognize any curve in plate 8 at all, or any lower
  curve are definitely abnormal.
\item
  They might be abnormal if they misjudge more than 3 plates among
  plates 3,4,6,7
\item
  If they misjudge 1-2 plates among plates 3,4,6,7, it is better to
  re-examine him in details from plate 1-8.
\item
  Report the result into Qualtrics
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Stereo Vision Test}\label{stereo-vision-test}

\subparagraph{Procedure}\label{procedure-2}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Have the participant put the stereo glasses on.
\item
  Provide good light, make sure the pictures maintain the proper axis of
  polarization before the participants at 15 minutes of arc at a
  distance of 16 inches.
\item
  Only do the circle test. Point to each item on the left hand side of
  the page going left to right and up to down.
\item
  Start with No.1.
\end{itemize}

Say:

\begin{quote}
``Look at each of the four circles and tell me which one seems to come
out closer to you-top, bottom, right, or left.''
\end{quote}

Continue until participant gives up trying, or making two successive
mistakes. - Some participants may develop this perceptual response
slowly. So let them study it for a while, if needed.
